The library assumes that the PPF library (files factory.h, factory.cpp, and 
pointer.cpp) is in subdirectory ppf.

Subdirectory alib contains the C++ non-persistent version of InCode library.
We need it only for codegen.exe, which is the same in plain InCode and in 
ppfIC. However, if you need to recompile codegen, you need the entire library
because codegen uses itself(!) when recompilling.

Check file setup.bat copies codegen.exe to this directory.

The description of the data organization is always assumed to be in file ds.def
(data structure definitions). As with all Code Farms libraries, this file can
be used as input for the Layout program, which generates the UML class diagram
of your data organization.

Program test\diff.cpp must be compiled in order to run the tests which
are under directory 'test'. This is also done in setup.bat

Note that each directory in which you run the test needs a little file environ.h
which specifies whether the light, 4-byte persistent pointers can be used 
(PPF_LIGHT defined) or whether full, 8-byte persistent pointers are needed
(PPF_LIGHT not defined). The light version can be used if your data organization
does not include inheritance.
